#ProjectC README

This is a music project I am starting where I am integrating cello instrumentation with electronic instrumentation.

Electronic elements wilk consist of mostly sonic textures compiled with Paul Batchelor's lightweight stack-based synthesis program [Sporth](https://github.com/PaulBatchelor/Sporth).

This is all open source but I would like you to give credit when using anything that is in this repo. Check out the [creative commons license](LISCENCE.txt) for more info.

I hope you enjoy! :)
